# Deployment

The website was developed using Gitpod workspace to commit and push to GitHub. The project uses GitHub for hosting and has been deployed using Heroku.
To access to my page please follow these steps: 

## Clone Repository

* GitHub navigate to **andrius-siup/recipe-book**.
* Click the **Code** button.
* To clone with **HTTPS** copy the URL in the box https://github.com/andrius-siup/recipe-book.git
* Open your Git Bash.
* Changed the directory to the location you want to clone to be made.
* Type git clone than paste the copied URL  `git clone https://github.com/andrius-siup/recipe-book.git` . 
* Enter and your local clone will be created.

## Creating an env.py file

Install Flask, in your terminal type `pip3 install Flask` , that sets up Flask functionality. Next you will need to create **env.py** file for storing sensitive data, 
type `touch env.py` in terminal. This file should never be pushed to GitHub, so type `touch .gitignore` to be able to ignore it. Than open the **.gitignore** file and lets 
ignore your **env.py** file typed:
```
env.py
__pycache__/ 

```
save and close it.

In the env.py file we need to hide several bits of data. Open env.py file and type:
```
import os

os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "********")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "********")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "recipe_manager")
```
Make sure that your env.py file isn't being tracked, type  `git status` and make sure that you can not see it listed.

## MongoDB schema

To create the data schema in your MongoDB Atlas, create a new database called **recipe_manager**, add three collections **categories**, **recipes**, **users**.

* categories 
    * category_name
* recipes
    * recipe_name 
    * ingredients_list **should be set into an array**
    * recipe_img
    * prep_time
    * cook_time
    * serves
    * instructions **should be set into an array**
    * created_by
* users
    * username
    * password                

## Deployment to Heroku

To deploy the app using Heroku, use the following steps:
1. In terminal type `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt` to create a list of the dependencies for the website.
1. Create a Procfile, is what Heroku looks for to know which file runs the app. Type in terminal `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`
1. Use git commands to stage, commit and pushed these files to your GitHub.
1. Go to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) page and login.
1. Create new app by click on **New** and **Create New App** . Enter your unique app name, select your region and than click **create app**.
1. In the Deployment method section, select **GitHub - connect to GitHub** to set up automatic deployment from your GitHub repository.
1. Enter your repository name in the input field, and click search. Once is found your repository click connect.
1. To be able to read Heroku environment variables go to **Settings**  than click on **Reveal Config Vars** .
1. Add the following variables:
   * KEY **IP**  VALUE **0.0.0.0** click Add
   * KEY **PORT**  VALUE **5000** click Add
   * KEY **SECRET_KEY** VALUE **same unique key as you set it in env.py**
   * KEY **MONGO_URI** VALUE
   * KEY **MONGO_DBNAME** VALUE **recipe_manager**
1. Go back to **Deploy** tab, but before that go back to terminal and push requirement.txt and Procfile to GitHub. After that in Heroku you can click **Enable Automatic Deploys**.
1. Than click on the **Deploy Branch**
1. After less than minute to build you will see **Your app was successfully deployed**, click **View** to lounch the app.
